Java Infos

What is Java?
- Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language created by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle) in 1995.
- It’s designed to be platform-independent, meaning you can write code once and run it anywhere — this is called:
--- “Write Once, Run Anywhere” (WORA)

How Java Works
- You write your code in a .java file.
- The Java Compiler (javac) converts it into bytecode (.class file).
- The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) runs the bytecode on any operating system.

Main Features
- Object-Oriented: uses classes, objects, inheritance, etc.
- Platform-Independent: runs on any OS with JVM.
- Robust & Secure: strong memory management and security features.
- Multithreaded: can perform multiple tasks at once.
- Automatic Garbage Collection: cleans up unused memory automatically.

Basic Building Blocks
- Class: blueprint of objects
- Object: instance of a class
- Method: performs actions
- Variable: stores data

Common Uses
- Android app development
- Web applications (e.g., Spring Framework)
- Enterprise software
- Games and desktop apps
- Backend systems and servers

Example Code
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
