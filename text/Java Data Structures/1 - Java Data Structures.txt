Java Data Structures 

Java Data Structures
- Data structures are ways to store and organize data so you can use it efficiently.
- An array is an example of a data structure, which allows multiple elements to be stored in a single variable.
- Java includes many other data structures as well, in the java.util package. Each used to handle data in different ways.
- Some of the most common are:
--- ArrayList
--- HashSet 
--- HashMap
- Tip: Data structure are like supercharged arrays - more flexible and feature-rich!
- We'll explore all of these - and many more - in detail later, but for now, here's a quick introduction to each one.

ArrayList
- An ArrayList is a resizable array that can grows as needed.
- It allows you to store elements and access them by index.
- Example

// Import the ArrayList class
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> cars = new ArrayList<String>();
        cars.add("Volvo");
        cars.add("BMW");
        cars.add("Ford");
        cars.add("Mazda");
        System.out.println(cars);
    }
}

HashSet
- A HashSet is a collection where every element is unique - no duplicates are allowed.
- Example

// Import the HashSet class
import java.util.HashSet;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HashSet<String> cars = new HashSet<String>();
        cars.add("Volvo");
        cars.add("BMW");
        cars.add("Ford");
        cars.add("BMW");  // Duplicate
        cars.add("Mazda");
        System.out.println(cars);
    }
}

- Note: In the example above, even though BMW is added twice it only appears once in the set because every element in a set has to be unique.

HashMap
- A HashMap stores key-value pairs, which are great when you want to store values and find them by a key (like a name or ID):
- Example

// Import the HashMap class
import java.util.HashMap;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a HashMap object called capitalCities
        HashMap<String, String> capitalCities = new HashMap<String, String>();

        // Add keys and values (Country, City)
        capitalCities.put("England", "London");
        capitalCities.put("Germany", "Berlin");
        capitalCities.put("Norway", "Oslo");
        capitalCities.put("USA", "Washington DC");
        System.out.println(capitalCities);
    }
}

Data Structures Overview

Data Structure	Stores	            Keeps Order?	Allows Duplicates?	    Best For
ArrayList	    Ordered elements	Yes	            Yes	                    Accessing elements by index
HashSet	        Unique elements	    No	            No	                    Avoiding duplicates, fast checks
HashMap	        Key-value pairs	    No	            Yes (keys are unique)	Fast lookup by key

Iterators
- When learning about data structures, you will often hear about iterators too.
- An iterator is a way to loop through elements in a data structure.
- It is called an "iterator" because "iterating" is the technical term for looping.
- Example: Using an Iterator with ArrayList:

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Iterator;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an ArrayList of Strings
        ArrayList<String> cars = new ArrayList<String>();
        cars.add("Volvo");
        cars.add("BMW");
        cars.add("Ford");
        cars.add("Mazda");

        // Get an iterator for the ArrayList
        Iterator<String> it = cars.iterator();

        // Iterate through the list using the iterator
        while(it.hasNext()) {
            System.out.println(it.next());
        }
    }
}

- Next, let's take a closer look at each data structure in more detail.
