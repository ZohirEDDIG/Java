Java Collections Framework

The Collections Framework
- Before we explore ArrayList, HashSet, HashMap, and other data structures in more detail, it's important to understand that all of these are part of something bigger - the Java Collections Framework.
- The Java Collections Framework provides a set of interfaces (like List, Set, and Map) and a set of classes (ArrayList, HashSet, HashMap, etc.) that implement those interfaces.
- All of these are part of the java.util package.
- They are used to store, search, sort, and organize data more easily - all using standardized methods and patterns.
- Tip: Think of the Collections Framework as a toolbox.
- Interfaces like List define what tools can do, and classes like ArrayList are the actual tools that do the work.

Core Interfaces in the Collections Framework
- Here are some common interfaces, along with their classes:

Interface	Common Classes	                    Description
List	    ArrayList, LinkedList	            Ordered collection that allows duplicates
Set	        HashSet, TreeSet, LinkedHashSet	    Collection of unique elements
Map	        HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap	    Stores key-value pairs with unique keys

Overview of Classes
- The table below gives an overview of the common data structure classes and their characteristics:

Interface	        Class	            Description
List	            ArrayList	        Resizable array that maintains order and allows duplicates
                    LinkedList	        List with fast insert and remove operations
Set             	HashSet	Unordered   collection of unique elements
                    TreeSet     	    Sorted set of unique elements (natural order)
                    LinkedHashSet	    Maintains the order in which elements were inserted
Map	                HashMap	            Stores key/value pairs with no specific order
                    TreeMap	            Sorted map based on the natural order of keys
                    LinkedHashMap       Maintains the order in which keys were inserted


- Use List classes when you care about order, you may have duplicates, and want to access elements by index.
- Use Set classes when you need to store unique values only.
- Use Map classes when you need to store pairs of keys and values, like a name and its phone number.

What's Next?
- In the next chapters, you will learn how to use each of these data structures in detail - how to add, remove, sort, and search elements, and choose the right structure for your task.
