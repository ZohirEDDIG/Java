Java Class Attributes

Java Class Attributes
- In the previous chapter, we used the term "variable" for x in the example (as shown below). It is actually an attribute of the class. Or you could say that class attributes are variables within a class:
- Create a class called "Main" with two attributes: x and y:

public class Main {
    int x = 5;
    int y = 3;
}

- Another term for class attributes is fields.

Accessing Attributes
- You can access attributes by creating an object of the class, and by using the dot syntax (.):
- The following example will create an object of the Main class, with the name myObj. We use the x attribute on the object to print its value:
- Example: Create an object called "myObj" and print the value of x:

public class Main {
    int x = 5;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Main myObj = new Main();
        System.out.println(myObj.x);
    }
}

Modify Attributes
- You can also modify attribute values:
- Example: Set the value of x to 40:

public class Main {
    int x;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Main myObj = new Main();
        myObj.x = 40;
        System.out.println(myObj.x);
    }
}

- Or override existing values:
- Example: Change the value of x to 25:

public class Main {
    int x = 10;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Main myObj = new Main();
        myObj.x = 25; // x is now 25
        System.out.println(myObj.x);
    }
}


- If you don't want the ability to override existing values, declare the attribute as final:
- Example 

public class Main {
    final int x = 10;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Main myObj = new Main();
        myObj.x = 25; // will generate an error
        System.out.println(myObj.x); 
    }
}

- The final keyword is useful when you want a variable to always store the same value, like PI (3.14159...).
- The final keyword is called a "modifier". You will learn more about these in the Java Modifiers Chapter.

Multiple Attributes
- You can specify as many attributes as you want:
- Example

public class Main {
    String fname = "John";
    String lname = "Doe";
    int age = 24;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Main myObj = new Main();
        System.out.println("Name: " + myObj.fname + " " + myObj.lname);
        System.out.println("Age: " + myObj.age);
    }
}

- The next chapter will teach you how to create class methods and how to access them with objects.
