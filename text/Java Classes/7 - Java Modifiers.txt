Java Modifiers

Modifiers
- By now, you are quite familiar with the public keyword that appears in almost all of our examples:

public class Main

- The public keyword is an access modifier, meaning that it is used to set the access level for classes, attributes, methods and constructors.
- We divide modifiers into two groups:

Access Modifiers - controls the access level
Non-Access Modifiers - do not control access level, but provides other functionality

Access Modifiers
- For classes, you can use either public or default:

Modifier	Description
public      The class is accessible by any other class
default     The class is only accessible by classes in the same package. This is used when you don't specify a modifier. You will learn more about packages in the Packages chapter

- For attributes, methods and constructors, you can use the one of the following:

Modifier	Description
public	    The code is accessible for all classes
private	    The code is only accessible within the declared class
default	    The code is only accessible in the same package. This is used when you don't specify a modifier. You will learn more about packages in the Packages chapter
protected	The code is accessible in the same package and subclasses. You will learn more about subclasses and superclasses in the Inheritance chapter

Public vs. Private Example
- In the example below, the class has one public attribute and one private attribute.
- Think of it like real life:
--- public - a public park, everyone can enter
--- private - your house key, only you can use it
- Example

class Person {
    public String name = "John";   // Public - accessible everywhere
    private int age = 30;          // Private - only accessible inside this class
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person p = new Person();
        System.out.println(p.name);   // Works fine
        System.out.println(p.age);    // Error: age has private access in Person
    }
}

Example explained
- Here, name is declared as public, so it can be accessed from outside the Person class. But age is declared as private, so it can only be used inside the Person class.

Java Non-Access Modifiers

- Non-Access Modifiers
- Non-access modifiers do not control visibility (like public or private), but instead add other features to classes, methods, and attributes.
- The most commonly used non-access modifiers are final, static, and abstract.

Final
- If you don't want the ability to override existing attribute values, declare attributes as final:
- Example

public class Main {
    final int x = 10;
    final double PI = 3.14;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Main myObj = new Main();
        myObj.x = 50; // will generate an error
        myObj.PI = 25; // will generate an error
        System.out.println(myObj.x); 
    }
}

Static
- A static method belongs to the class, not to any specific object. This means you can call it without creating an object of the class.
- Example: A simple example showing how to call a static method directly:

public class Main {
    // Static method
    static void myStaticMethod() {
        System.out.println("Static methods can be called without creating objects");
    }

    // Main method
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        myStaticMethod();           // Call the static method
        Main.myStaticMethod();      // Or call it using the class name
    }
}

- Note: A static method belongs to the class itself. You can call it without creating an object, but it cannot use variables or methods that belong to an object.

Abstract
- An abstract method belongs to an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the subclass:

Main.java 

// abstract class
abstract class Main {
    public String fname = "John";
    public int age = 24;
    public abstract void study(); // abstract method
}

// Subclass (inherit from Main)
class Student extends Main {
    public int graduationYear = 2018;
    public void study() { // the body of the abstract method is provided here
        System.out.println("Studying all day long");
    }
}

Second.java

class Second {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // create an object of the Student class (which inherits attributes and methods from Main)
        Student myObj = new Student(); 
        
        System.out.println("Name: " + myObj.fname);
        System.out.println("Age: " + myObj.age);
        System.out.println("Graduation Year: " + myObj.graduationYear);
        myObj.study(); // call abstract method
    }
}

For classes, you can use either final or abstract:

Modifier	Description
final	    The class cannot be inherited by other classes (You will learn more about inheritance in the Inheritance chapter)	
abstract	The class cannot be used to create objects (To access an abstract class, it must be inherited from another class. You will learn more about inheritance and abstraction in the Inheritance and Abstraction chapters)

- For attributes and methods, you can use the one of the following:

Modifier	    Description
final	        Attributes and methods cannot be overridden/modified
static	        Attributes and methods belong to the class, not to objects. This means all objects share the same static attribute, and static methods can be called without creating objects.
abstract        Can only be used in an abstract class, and can only be used on methods. The method does not have a body, for example abstract void run();. The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from). You will learn more about inheritance and abstraction in the Inheritance and Abstraction chapters
transient	    Attributes and methods are skipped when serializing the object containing them
synchronized	Methods can only be accessed by one thread at a time
volatile	    The value of an attribute is not cached thread-locally, and is always read from the "main memory"
