Java this

Java this Keyword
- The this keyword in Java refers to the current object in a method or constructor.
- The this keyword is often used to avoid confusion when class attributes have the same name as method or constructor parameters.

Accessing Class Attributes
- Sometimes a constructor or method has a parameter with the same name as a class variable. When this happens, the parameter temporarily hides the class variable inside that method or constructor.
- To refer to the class variable and not the parameter, you can use the this keyword:
- Example

public class Main {
    int x; 

    public Main(int x) {
        this.x = x; // refers to the class variable x
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Main myObj = new Main(5);
        System.out.println("Value of x = " + myObj.x);
    }
}

- Output:

Value of x = 5

- Tip: Think of this.x = x; as: "this.x (the class variable) gets the value of x (the parameter)."
- Without this, the code above x = x; would set the parameter x equal to itself, and the class variable would stay uninitialized (0).

Calling a Constructor from Another Constructor
- You can also use this() to call another constructor in the same class.
- This is useful when you want to provide default values or reuse initialization code instead of repeating it.
- Example

public class Main {
    int modelYear;
    String modelName;

    // Constructor with one parameter
    public Main(String modelName) {
        // Call the two-parameter constructor to reuse code and set a default year    
        this(2020, modelName);
    }

    // Constructor with two parameters
    public Main(int modelYear, String modelName) {
        // Use 'this' to assign values to the class variables
        this.modelYear = modelYear;
        this.modelName = modelName;
    }

    // Method to print car information
    public void printInfo() {
        System.out.println(modelYear + " " + modelName);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a car with only model name (uses default year)
        Main car1 = new Main("Corvette");

        // Create a car with both model year and name
        Main car2 = new Main(1969, "Mustang");

        car1.printInfo();
        car2.printInfo();
    }
}

- Output:

2020 Corvette
1969 Mustang

- Note: The call to this() must be the first statement inside the constructor.

When to use this?
- When a constructor or method has a parameter with the same name as a class variable, use this to update the class variable correctly.
- To call another constructor in the same class and reuse code.
