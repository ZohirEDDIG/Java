Java Enums

Enums
- An enum is a special "class" that represents a group of constants (unchangeable variables, like final variables).
- To create an enum, use the enum keyword (instead of class or interface), and separate the constants with a comma. Note that they should be in uppercase letters:
- Example

enum Level {
    LOW,
    MEDIUM,
    HIGH
}

- You can access enum constants with the dot syntax:

public class Main { 
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        Level myVar = Level.MEDIUM; 
        System.out.println(myVar); 
    } 
}

- Enum is short for "enumerations", which means "specifically listed".

Enum inside a Class
- You can also have an enum inside a class:
- Example

public class Main { 
    enum Level {
        LOW,
        MEDIUM,
        HIGH
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        Level myVar = Level.MEDIUM; 
        System.out.println(myVar); 
    } 
}

- The output will be:

MEDIUM

Enum in a Switch Statement
- Enums are often used in switch statements to check for corresponding values:
- Example

enum Level {
    LOW,
    MEDIUM,
    HIGH
}

public class Main { 
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Level myVar = Level.MEDIUM; 
                    
        switch(myVar) {
            case LOW:
                System.out.println("Low level");
                break;
            case MEDIUM:
                System.out.println("Medium level");
                break;
            case HIGH:
                System.out.println("High level");
                break;
        }
    }
}

- The output will be:

Medium level

Loop Through an Enum
- The enum type has a values() method, which returns an array of all enum constants. This method is useful when you want to loop through the constants of an enum:
- Example

for (Level myVar : Level.values()) {
    System.out.println(myVar);
}

- The output will be:

LOW
MEDIUM
HIGH


Difference between Enums and Classes
- An enum can, just like a class, have attributes and methods. The only difference is that enum constants are public, static and final (unchangeable - cannot be overridden).
- An enum cannot be used to create objects, and it cannot extend other classes (but it can implement interfaces).

Why And When To Use Enums?
- Use enums when you have values that you know aren't going to change, like month days, days, colors, deck of cards, etc

Java Enum Constructor

Enum Constructor
- An enum can also have a constructor just like a class.
- The constructor is called automatically when the constants are created. You cannot call it yourself.
- Here, each constant in the enum has a value (a string) that is set through the constructor:

enum Level {
    // Enum constants (each has its own description)
    LOW("Low level"),
    MEDIUM("Medium level"),
    HIGH("High level");

    // Field (variable) to store the description text
    private String description;

    // Constructor (runs once for each constant above)
    private Level(String description) {
        this.description = description;
    }

  // Getter method to read the description
    public String getDescription() {
        return description;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Level myVar = Level.MEDIUM; // Pick one enum constant
        System.out.println(myVar.getDescription()); // Prints "Medium level"
    }
}

- The output will be:

Medium level

- Note: The constructor for an enum must be private. If you don't write private, Java adds it automatically.

Loop Through Enum with Constructor
- You can also loop through the constants and print their values using the values() method:

for (Level myVar : Level.values()) {
    System.out.println(myVar + ": " + myVar.getDescription());
}

- The output will be:

LOW: Low level
MEDIUM: Medium level
HIGH: High level
