Java Class Methods

Java Class Methods
- You learned from the Java Methods chapter that methods are declared within a class, and that they are used to perform certain actions:
- Create a method named myMethod() in Main:

public class Main {
    static void myMethod() {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}

- myMethod() prints a text (the action), when it is called. To call a method, write the method's name followed by two parentheses () and a semicolon;
- Example: Inside main, call myMethod():

public class Main {
    static void myMethod() {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        myMethod();
    }
}

Access Methods With an Object
- Example: Create a Car object named myCar. Call the fullThrottle() and speed() methods on the myCar object, and run the program:

// Create a Main class
public class Main {
    // Create a fullThrottle() method
    public void fullThrottle() {
        System.out.println("The car is going as fast as it can!");
    }

    // Create a speed() method and add a parameter
    public void speed(int maxSpeed) {
        System.out.println("Max speed is: " + maxSpeed);
    }

    // Inside main, call the methods on the myCar object
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Main myCar = new Main();     // Create a myCar object
        myCar.fullThrottle();      // Call the fullThrottle() method
        myCar.speed(200);          // Call the speed() method
    }
}

Example explained
- 1) We created a custom Main class with the class keyword.
- 2) We created the fullThrottle() and speed() methods in the Main class.
- 3) The fullThrottle() method and the speed() method will print out some text, when they are called.
- 4) The speed() method accepts an int parameter called maxSpeed - we will use this in 8).
- 5) In order to use the Main class and its methods, we need to create an object of the Main Class.
- 6) Then, go to the main() method, which you know by now is a built-in Java method that runs your program (any code inside main is executed).
- 7) By using the new keyword we created an object with the name myCar.
- 8) Then, we call the fullThrottle() and speed() methods on the myCar object, and run the program using the name of the object (myCar), followed by a dot (.), followed by the name of the method (fullThrottle(); and speed(200);). Notice that we add an int parameter of 200 inside the speed() method.

Remember that..
- The dot (.) is used to access the object's attributes and methods.
- To call a method in Java, write the method name followed by a set of parentheses (), followed by a semicolon (;).
- A class must have a matching filename (Main and Main.java).

Using Multiple Classes
- Like we specified in the Classes chapter, it is a good practice to create an object of a class and access it in another class.
- Remember that the name of the java file should match the class name. In this example, we have created two files in the same directory:

Main.java
Second.java

Main.java 

public class Main {
    public void fullThrottle() {
        System.out.println("The car is going as fast as it can!");
    }

    public void speed(int maxSpeed) {
        System.out.println("Max speed is: " + maxSpeed);
    }
}

Second.java

class Second {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Main myCar = new Main();     // Create a myCar object
        myCar.fullThrottle();      // Call the fullThrottle() method
        myCar.speed(200);          // Call the speed() method
    }
}

- When both files have been compiled:

javac Main.java
javac Second.java

- Run the Second.java file:

Run the Second.java file:

And the output will be:

The car is going as fast as it can!
Max speed is: 200
