Java Anonymous Class

Anonymous Class
- An anonymous class is a class without a name. It is created and used at the same time.
- You often use anonymous classes to override methods of an existing class or interface, without writing a separate class file.
- Here, we create an anonymous class that extends another class and overrides its method:

// Normal class
class Animal {
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Animal sound");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Anonymous class that overrides makeSound()
        Animal myAnimal = new Animal() {
        public void makeSound() {
            System.out.println("Woof woof");
        }
        }; // semicolon is required to end the line of code that creates the object

        myAnimal.makeSound();
    }
}

- The output will be:

Woof woof

Anonymous Class from an Interface
- You can also use an anonymous class to implement an interface on the fly:

// Interface
interface Greeting {
    void sayHello();
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Anonymous class that implements Greeting
        Greeting greet = new Greeting() {
            public void sayHello() {
                System.out.println("Hello, World!");
            }
        };

        greet.sayHello();
    }
}

- The output will be:

Hello, World!

When to Use Anonymous Classes?
- Use anonymous classes when you need to create a short class for one-time use. For example:
--- Overriding a method without creating a new subclass
--- Implementing an interface quickly
--- Passing small pieces of behavior as objects
