Java Arrays

Java Arrays
- Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.
- To declare an array, define the variable type with square brackets [ ] :

String[] cars;

- We have now declared a variable that holds an array of strings. To insert values to it, you can place the values in a comma-separated list, inside curly braces { }:

String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};

- To create an array of integers, you could write:

int[] myNum = {10, 20, 30, 40};

Access the Elements of an Array
- You can access an array element by referring to the index number.
- This statement accesses the value of the first element in cars:
- Example

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
        System.out.println(cars[0]);
    }
}

- Note: Array indexes start with 0: [0] is the first element. [1] is the second element, etc.
- Think of an array as numbered boxes, where each box stores an element:

Index	Element
0	    Volvo
1	    BMW
2	    Ford
3	    Mazda

Change an Array Element
- To change the value of a specific element, refer to the index number:

cars[0] = "Opel";

- Example

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
        cars[0] = "Opel";
        System.out.println(cars[0]);
    }
}

Array Length
- To find out how many elements an array has, use the length property:
- Example

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
        System.out.println(cars.length);
    }
}

The new Keyword
- You can also create an array by specifying its size with new. This makes an empty array with space for a fixed number of elements, which you can fill later:
- Example

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String[] cars = new String[4]; // size is 4

        cars[0] = "Volvo";
        cars[1] = "BMW";
        cars[2] = "Ford";
        cars[3] = "Mazda";

        System.out.println(cars[0]); // Outputs Volvo 
    }
}

- However, if you already know the values, you don't need to write new. Both of these create the same array:
- Example

// With new
String[] cars = new String[] {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};

// Shortcut (most common)
String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};

- Note: You cannot write new String[4] {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"}.
- In Java, when using new, you either:
- Use new String[4] to create an empty array with 4 slots, and then fill them later
- Or use new String[] {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"} (without specifying the number of elements) to create the array and assign values at the same time
- Tip: The shortcut syntax is most often used when the values are known at the start. Use new with a size when you want to create an empty array and fill it later

Java Arrays Loop

Loop Through an Array
- You can loop through the array elements with the for loop, and use the length property to specify how many times the loop should run.
- This example creates an array of strings and then uses a for loop to print each element, one by one:
- Example 

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
        for (int i = 0; i < cars.length; i++) {
    
        }
    }
}

- Here is a similar example with numbers. We create an array of integers and use a for loop to print each value:
- Example

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40};

        for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
            System.out.println(numbers[i]);
        }
    }
}

Calculate the Sum of Elements
- Now that you know how to work with arrays and loops, let's use them together to calculate the sum of all elements in an array:
- Example

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {1, 5, 10, 25};
        int sum = 0;

        // Loop through the array and add each element to sum
        for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
            sum += numbers[i];
        }

        System.out.println("The sum is: " + sum);
    }
}

Loop Through an Array with For-Each
- There is also a "for-each" loop, which is used exclusively to loop through elements in an array (or other data structures):
- Syntax

for (type variable : arrayname) {
    // code block to be executed
}

- The colon (:) is read as "in". So you can read the loop as: "for each variable in array".
- The following example uses a for-each loop to print all elements in the cars array:
- Example

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
        
        for (String car : cars) {
            System.out.println(car);
        }    
    }
}

- This means: for each String in the cars array (here called car), print its value.
- Compared to a regular for loop, the for-each loop is easier to write and read because it does not need a counter (like i < cars.length). However, it only gives you the values, not their positions (indexes) in the array.
- So, if you need both the position (index) of each element and its value, a regular for loop is the right choice. For example, when printing seat numbers in a theater row, you need to show both the seat number (the index) and who is sitting there (the value):
- Example 

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String[] seats = {"Jenny", "Liam", "Angie", "Bo"};

        for (int i = 0; i < seats.length; i++) {
            System.out.println("Seat number " + i + " is taken by " + seats[i]);
        }
    }
}

- Note: The for-each loop is great when you only need to read elements. If you want to change the elements later, or keep track of their index, use a regular for loop instead.

Java Arrays - Real-Life Examples

Real-Life Example
- To demonstrate a practical example of using arrays, let's create a program that calculates the average of different ages:
- Example 

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // An array storing different ages
        int ages[] = {20, 22, 18, 35, 48, 26, 87, 70};

        float avg, sum = 0;

        // Get the length of the array
        int length = ages.length;

        // Loop through the elements of the array
        for (int age : ages) {
            sum += age;
        }
        
        // Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the length
        avg = sum / length;

        // Print the average
        System.out.println("The average age is: " + avg);
    }
}

- And in this example, we create a program that finds the lowest age among different ages:
- Example

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // An array storing different ages
        int ages[] = {20, 22, 18, 35, 48, 26, 87, 70};

        // Get the length of the array
        int length = ages.length;
        
        // Create a 'lowest age' variable and assign the first array element of ages to it
        int lowestAge = ages[0];

        // Loop through the elements of the ages array to find the lowest age
        for (int age : ages) {
            // Check if the current age is smaller than the current 'lowest age'
            if (lowestAge > age) {
                // If the smaller age is found, update 'lowest age' with that element
                lowestAge = age;
            }
        }

        // Output the value of the lowest age
        System.out.println("The lowest age in the array is: " + lowestAge);
    }
}

- Create a program with a list of numbers where you want to skip negative values, but stop completely if you find a zero:
- Example

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {3, -1, 7, 0, 9};

        for (int n : numbers) {
            if (n < 0) {
                continue; // skip negative numbers
            }
            if (n == 0) {
                break; // stop loop when zero is found
            }
            System.out.println(n);
        }
    }
}

- Create a program that keeps track of the highest and lowest values in an array:
- Example 

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {45, 12, 98, 33, 27};

        int max = numbers[0];
        int min = numbers[0];

        for (int n : numbers) {
            if (n > max) {
                max = n;
            }
            if (n < min) {
                min = n;
            }
        }

        System.out.println("Max: " + max);
        System.out.println("Min: " + min);
    }
}

- Create a program that prints the seat numbers in a theater row, showing both the seat number (the index) and who is sitting there (the value):
- Example 

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String[] seats = {"Jenny", "Liam", "Angie", "Bo"};

        for (int i = 0; i < seats.length; i++) {
            System.out.println("Seat number " + i + " is taken by " + seats[i]);
        }
    }
}

Java Multi-Dimensional Arrays

- Multidimensional Arrays
- A multidimensional array is an array that contains other arrays.
- You can use it to store data in a table with rows and columns.
- To create a two-dimensional array, write each row inside its own curly braces:

int[][] myNumbers = { {1, 4, 2}, {3, 6, 8} };

- Here, myNumbers has two arrays (two rows):
--- First row: {1, 4, 2}
--- Second row: {3, 6, 8}
- Think of it like this:


                        COLUMN 0     COLUMN 1   COLUMN 3
ROW 0                   1            4          2
ROW 1                   3            6          8

- Access Elements
- To access an element of a two-dimensional array, you need two indexes: the first for the row, and the second for the column.
- Remember: Array indexes start at 0. That means row 0 is the first row, and column 0 is the first column. (So row index 1 is the second row, and column index 2 is the third column.)
- This statement accesses the element in the second row (index 1) and third column (index 2) of the myNumbers array:
- Example

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] myNumbers = { {1, 4, 2}, {3, 6, 8} };
        System.out.println(myNumbers[1][2]);
    }
}

- This example prints the value at row 0, column 1:
- Example 

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] myNumbers = { {1, 4, 2}, {3, 6, 8} };
        System.out.println(myNumbers[0][1]);
    }
}


Change Element Values
- You can overwrite an existing element using the same two-index notation (row, then column):
- Example

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] myNumbers = { {1, 4, 2}, {3, 6, 8} };
        myNumbers[1][2] = 9;
        System.out.println(myNumbers[1][2]); // Outputs 9 instead of 8
    }
}

Rows and Columns (Lengths)
- You can use length to get the number of rows, and myNumbers[row].length for the number of columns in a given row:
- Example: Sizes

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] myNumbers = { {1, 4, 2}, {3, 6, 8, 5, 2} };
        
        System.out.println("Rows: " + myNumbers.length);             // 2
        System.out.println("Cols in row 0: " + myNumbers[0].length); // 3
        System.out.println("Cols in row 1: " + myNumbers[1].length); // 5
    }
}

- Note: Notice how rows can have different lengths - In this example, the second row has more elements than the first, and that's perfectly valid in Java.

Loop Through a Multidimensional Array
- Use a for loop inside another for loop to visit every element (row by row):
- Example

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] myNumbers = { {1, 4, 2}, {3, 6, 8, 5, 2} };

        for (int row = 0; row < myNumbers.length; row++) {
            for (int col = 0; col < myNumbers[row].length; col++) {
                System.out.println("myNumbers[" + row + "][" + col + "] = " + myNumbers[row][col]);
            }
        }
    }
}

- Or use a for-each loop in both levels, which many find easier to read:
- Example

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] myNumbers = { {1, 4, 2}, {3, 6, 8, 5, 2} };

        for (int[] row : myNumbers) {
            for (int num : row) {
                System.out.println(num);
            }
        }
    }
}

Print Arrays
- In Java, when you print an array directly, it doesn’t print the contents.
- Instead, it prints the type ([I for integer array, [Ljava.lang.String; for String array) and a hashcode in hexadecimal — basically a memory reference.
- Example

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        int[] nums = {10, 20, 30};

        String[] cars = {"BMW", "Golf", "Porshe"};

        System.out.println(nums); 

        System.out.println(cars); 
    }
}

- Result 

[I@5ca881b5
[Ljava.lang.String;@24d46ca6

- To print an array, you must do this 
- Example

import java.util.Arrays;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        int[] nums = {10, 20, 30};

        String[] cars = {"BMW", "Golf", "Porshe"};

        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(nums)); 
        
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(cars));
    }
}

Array vs ArrayList
- Array: fixed size, can’t grow or shrink
- Example:

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        int[] nums = {10, 20, 30};
    }
}

- You can’t add or remove elements later.
- ArrayList: resizable array (can grow or shrink).
- Example

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        ArrayList<Integer> nums = new ArrayList<>();
        nums.add(1);
        nums.add(2);
        nums.remove(0);
    }
}

- You can add or remove items anytime.
- Top: Use Array when size is fixed and use ArrayList when size can change.
