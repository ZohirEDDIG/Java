Java Switch

Java Switch Statements
- Instead of writing many if..else statements, you can use the switch statement.
- Think of it like ordering food in a restaurant: If you choose number 1, you get Pizza. If you choose 2, you get a Burger. If you choose 3, you get Pasta. Otherwise, you get nothing.
- The switch statement selects one of many code blocks to be executed:
- Syntax 

switch(expression) {
    case x:
        // code block
        break;
    case y:
        // code block
        break;
    default:
        // code block
}

- This is how it works:
--- The switch expression is evaluated once.
--- The result is compared with each case value.
--- If there is a match, the matching block of code runs.
--- The break statement stops the switch after the matching case has run.
--- The default statement runs if there is no match.
--- The example below uses the weekday number to calculate the weekday name:
- Example 

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int day = 4;
        switch (day) {
            case 1:
                System.out.println("Monday");
                break;
            case 2:
                System.out.println("Tuesday");
                break;
            case 3:
                System.out.println("Wednesday");
                break;
            case 4:
                System.out.println("Thursday");
                break;
            case 5:
                System.out.println("Friday");
                break;
            case 6:
                System.out.println("Saturday");
                break;
            case 7:
                System.out.println("Sunday");
                break;
            }
    }
}

The break Keyword
- When Java reaches a break keyword, it breaks out of the switch block.
- This will stop the execution of more code and case testing inside the block.
- When a match is found, and the job is done, it's time for a break. There is no need for more testing.
- A break can save a lot of execution time because it "ignores" the execution of all the rest of the code in the switch block.

The default Keyword
- The default keyword specifies some code to run if there is no case match:
- Example

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int day = 4;
        switch (day) {
        case 6:
            System.out.println("Today is Saturday");
            break;
        case 7:
            System.out.println("Today is Sunday");
            break;
        default:
            System.out.println("Looking forward to the Weekend");
        }    
    }
}

- Note that if the default statement is used as the last statement in a switch block, it does not need a break.
