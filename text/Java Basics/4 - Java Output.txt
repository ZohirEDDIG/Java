Java Output / Print

Print Text
- You learned from the previous chapter that you can use the println() method to output values or print text in Java:
- Example

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}

- You can add as many println() methods as you want. Note that it will add a new line for each method:
- Example

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
        System.out.println("I am learning Java.");
        System.out.println("It is awesome!");
    }
}

Double Quotes
- Text must be wrapped inside double quotations marks "".
- If you forget the double quotes, an error occurs:
- Example

System.out.println("This sentence will work!");
System.out.println(This sentence will produce an error);

The Print() Method
- There is also a print() method, which is similar to println().
- The only difference is that it does not insert a new line at the end of the output:
- Example

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.print("Hello World! ");
        System.out.print("I will print on the same line.");
    }
}

- Note that we add an extra space (after "Hello World!" in the example above) for better readability.
- In this tutorial, we will only use println() as it makes the code output easier to read.

Java Output Numbers

Print Numbers
- You can also use the println() method to print numbers.
- However, unlike text, we don't put numbers inside double quotes:
- Example

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(3);
        System.out.println(358);
        System.out.println(50000);
    }
}

- You can also perform mathematical calculations inside the println() method:
- Example

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(3 + 3);
    }
}

- Example

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(2 * 5);
    }
}
