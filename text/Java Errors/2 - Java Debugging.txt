Java Debugging 

Java Debugging
- After learning about common errors, the next step is understanding how to debug your Java code - that is, how to find and fix those errors effectively.
- This page introduces simple debugging techniques that are useful for beginners and helpful even for experienced developers.

What is Debugging?
- Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing errors or bugs in your code.
- It often involves 
--- Reading error messages 
--- Tracing variable values step by step
--- Testing small pieces of code independently
- Tip: Debugging is a skill that improves with practice, the more you debug, the better you get at spotting errors quickly. 

Print Statements for Debugging
- The most basic (and often most effective) way to debug Java code is to use System.out.println() to print values and check the flow of the program.
- In this example, the first line "Before division" will print, but the second line is never reached because the program crashes due to division by zero:
- Example 

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 10;
        int y = 0;

        System.out.println("Before division");  // Debug output

        int result = x / y;  // Crashes

        System.out.println("Result: " + result);  // Never runs
    }
}

- Result:

Before division
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero
        at Main.main(Main.java:8)

- Tip: Add print statements before and after key lines of code to find out where things go wrong.

Check Variable Values 
- If something unexpected happens, print ou the values of your variable:
- Example

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int age = 17;
        System.out.println("Age: " + age);

        if (age >= 18) {
            System.out.println("Access granted");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Access denied");
        }
    }
}

- Tip: This is a good way to test whether a condition is working correctly - try changing age to 18 or 19 and observe the output!

Debugging with IDEs 
- Modern IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, and NetBeans come with built-in debugging tools.
--- Set breakpoints to pause the program at specific  lines 
--- Step through code line by line
--- Inspect variable values in real time 
- Tip: Use your IDE's debugger to fined errors faster - it's more powerful than print statements alone!

Debugging Checklist 
- Read the full error message, it often tells you exactly what's wrong
- Check if all variables are initialized before use 
- Print variable values to trace the problem
- Watch for off-by-one errors in loops and arrays 
- Comment out sections of code to find bugs 
- In the next chapter, you will learn about how to handle errors gracefully in your programs with Java Exceptions.
