Java Errors 

Java Errors 
- Even experienced Java developers make mistakes. The key is learning how to spot and fix them!
- These pages cover common errors and helpful debugging tips to help you understand what's going wrong  and how to fix it.

Type of Errors in Java 
Error Type                  Description
Compile-Time Error          Detected by the compiler. Prevents code from running 
Runtime Error               Occurs while the program is being executed. Often casuses crashes 
Logical Error               Code runs but gives incorrect results. Hardest to find.

Common Compile-Time Errors 
- Compile time errors occur when the program cannot compile due to syntax and type issues.
- Here are some examples
--- 1) Missing Semicolon 
--- Example 

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 5
        System.out.println(x);
    }
}

--- Result:

Main.java:3: error: ';' expected
    int x = 5
             ^
1 error

--- Tip: Java requires a semicolon at the end of every statement (int x = 5;).
--- 2) Undeclared Variables
--- Example 

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(myVar);
    }
}

--- Result:

Main.java:3: error: cannot find symbol
    System.out.println(myVar);
                       ^
  symbol:   variable myVar
  location: class Main
1 error

--- Tip: You must declare a variable before using it (int myVar = 50;).
--- 3) Mismatched Types
--- Example 


public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = "Hello";
        System.out.println(x);
    }
}

--- Result:

Main.java:3: error: incompatible types: String cannot be converted to int
    int x = "Hello";
            ^
1 error

--- Tip: To make sure the value matches the variable type (String x = "Hello";).

Common Runtime Errors
- Runtime errors occur when the program compiles but crashes or behaves unexpectedly.
- Here are some examples:
--- 1) Division by Zero
--- Example 

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 10;
        int y = 0;
        int result = x / y;
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}

--- Result:

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero
	at Main.main(Main.java:5)

--- 2) Array Index Out of Bounds 
--- Example

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3};
        System.out.println(numbers[8]);
    }
}

--- Result:

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 8 out of bounds for length 3
	at Main.main(Main.java:4)

Logical Errors
- Logical errors happen when the code runs, but the result is not what you tought:
- Example:

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 10;
        int y = 2;
        int sum = x - y;
        System.out.println("x + y = " + sum);
    }
}

- Result:

x + y = 8

- Expected Result: 12
- Logical Error: The code mistakenly subtracts instead of adds.
- Tip: Test your program with different inputs to catch logic flaws (try using x + y instead). This is a part of debugging, which you will learn more about in the next chapter.

Good Habits to Avoid Errors 
- Use meaningful variable names 
- Read the error message carefully. What lines does it mention?
- Check for missing semicolons or braces 
- Look for typos io variable or method names
- In the next chapter, you will learn how to debug your code - how to find and fix bugs/errors in your program.
