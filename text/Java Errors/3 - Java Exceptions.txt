Java Exceptions - Try... Catch 

Java Exceptions
- As mentioned in the Errors chapter, different types of error can occur while running a program - such as coding mistakes, invalid input or unexpected situations.
- When an error occurs, Java will normally stop and generate an error message, the technical terms for this is: Java will throw an exception (throw an error).

Exception Handling (try and catch)
- Exception handilng lets you catch and handle errors during runtime - so your program doesn't crash.
- It uses different keywords:
- The try statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors  while it is being executed.
- The catch statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed, if an error occurs in the try block.
- The try  and catch keywords come in pairs:
- Syntax 

try {
    // Block of code to try
} catch (Exception e) {
    // Block of code to handle errors 
}

- Consider the following example:
- This will generate an error, because myNumbers[10] doesn't exist.

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] myNumbers = {1, 2, 3};
        System.out.println(myNumbers[10]);
    }
}

- The output will be something like this:

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 10
        at MyClass.main(MyClass.java:4)

- Note: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occurs when you try to access an index number that doesn't exist.
- If an error occurs ww can use try...catch to catch the error and execute some code to handle it:
- Example:

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            int[] myNumbers = {1, 2, 3};
            System.out.println(myNumbers[10]);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("Something went wrong.");
        }
    }
}

- The output will be:

Something went wrong.

Finally 
- The finally statement let's you execute code, after try...catch, regardless of the result:
- Example

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            int[] myNumbers = {1, 2, 3};
            System.out.println(myNumbers[10]);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("Something went wrong.");
        } finally {
            System.out.println("The 'try catch' if finished.");
        }
    }
}

- The output will be:

Something went wrong.
The 'try catch' is finished.

The throw keyword
- The throw statement allows you to create custom error
- The throw statement is used together with an exception type. There are many exception types available in Java:
--- ArithmeticException, FileNotFoundException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, SecurityException, etc:
- Example: Throw an exception if age is below 18 (print "Access denied"). if age is 18 or older, print "Access granted":

public class Main {
    static void checkAge(int age) {
        if (age < 18) {
            throw new ArithmeticException("Access denied - You must be at least 18 years old.")
        } else {
            System.out.println("Access granted - You are older enough!");
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        checkAge(15); // Set age to 15 (which is below 18...)
    }
}

- The output will be:

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException: Access denied - You must be at least 18 years old.
        at Main.checkAge(Main.java:4)
        at Main.main(Main.java:12)

- If age was 20, you would not get an exception:
- Example

public class Main {
    static void checkAge(int age) { 
        if (age < 18) {
            throw new ArithmeticException("Access denied - You must be at least 18 years old."); 
        } else {
            System.out.println("Access granted - You are old enough!"); 
        }
    } 
    
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        checkAge(20); 
    } 
}

-   The output will be:

Access granted - You are old enough!

Errors and Exception Types
- The table below shows some of the most common errors and exceptions in Java, with a short description of each:
Error/Exception	                Description
ArithmeticError	Occurs          when a numeric calculation goes wrong
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException	Occurs when trying to access an index number that does not exist in an array
ClassNotFoundException	        Occurs when trying to access a class that does not exist
FileNotFoundException	        Occurs when a file cannot be accessed
InputMismatchException	        Occurs when entering wrong input (e.g. text in a numerical input)
IOException	Occurs              when an input or output operation fails
NullPointerException	        Occurs when trying to access an object referece that is null
NumberFormatException	        Occurs when it is not possible to convert a specified string to a numeric type
StringIndexOutOfBoundsException	Occurs when trying to access a character in a String that does not exist
